We report the discovery of maser emission in the two lowest rotational transitions of CS.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Masers can be powerful tracers of gas motion on very small scales.
They trace disks orbiting high-mass stars and black holes.

The rotational transitions of CS have been theorized to mase
in some environments \citep{Schoenberg1988a}, but they have
never been observed as masers.

\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}
We report observations from three different observing programs.
ALMA 2013.1.01596.S \citep{Goddi2018a} observed band 6 (1 mm), 2017.1.00293.S
observed Band 3 (3 mm), and VLA 16B-202 observed VLA Q-band (7 mm).
The ALMA data were take in long-baseline configurations, and the VLA data
were taken in the most extended A array.

For the ALMA data, we use the pipeline-produced calibrated data for the
emission line maps.  The Band 6 (1 mm) continuum data were self-calibrated
as described in \citet{Goddi2018a}.  The VLA continuum data were calibrated
with the EVLA pipeline with RFI flagging and hanning smoothing disabled.
The continuum data were self-calibrated with 9 iterations of phase-only
corrections.  The line cubes were made using the pipeline-calibrated data.

We imaged the CS J=2-1 98 GHz line with robust 0.5 weighting with 3 \kms
channels, resulting in a beam $0.067\arcsec\times0.043\arcsec$.  The CS J=1-0
49 GHz line was included in a continuum band with 6 \kms resolution, and we
imaged it with robust 0 weighting, resulting in a beam
$0.043\arcsec\times0.037\arcsec$.
The SiO J=5-4 and J=2-1 lines and band 6 (1 mm) continuum were imaged with
robust 0.5 weighting.


We measure an offset between the VLA and ALMA images using the
\texttt{image-registration} toolkit to cross-correlate the images of W51 e2w.
W51 e2w is a bright, extended, highly structured HII region bright at all
observed wavelengths and therefore provides a high target to cross-calibrate
on.  The total measured offset is 0.029\arcsec, which is less than a beam in
all of the data sets used here but much larger than the expected relative
positional accuracy within the images.  The pointing uncertainty should
therefore be regarded as at least 0.029\arcsec.  We have corrected the VLA
Q-band images to match the ALMA images, assuming the ALMA data have more
reliable absolute positions.

\section{Results}
We report the detection of two transitions of CS, J=2-1 and J=1-0, with
peak brightness $T_{B,max}\approx6000$ K.
These lines peak at different locations both spatially (Figure
\ref{fig:overlay}) and spectrally (Figure \ref{fig:spectra}).
We report Gaussian fit parameters to the line profiles and to the peak intensity
images in Table \ref{tab:linepars}; the errors reported in the table are fit
errors assuming no correlation between the parameters, and they do not include
the systematic pointing accuracy problem noted in Section \ref{sec:observations}.

The CS J=2-1 line is observed in the blueshifted component of the outflow.
It has both a compact component, which we will refer to as the CS 2-1 maser,
and an extended component that traces the inner envelope of the blueshifted
outflow.  This extended component can be seen more clearly in the 42 \kms
channel of the channel maps (Figure \ref{fig:channelmaps}).  The maser
peak is located at the base of the blueshifted outflow (Figure
\ref{fig:overlay}) at a velocity of $v_{lsr}=34.50\pm0.07$ \kms.

\begin{figure*}[htp]

    \caption{An image of the SiO 5-4 outflow (red and blue corresponding to
    red and blueshifted emission integrated over 74-118 \kms and -32 to 55
    \kms, respectively) with continuum shown in green.  The contours show SiO
    2-1 in red (0.05, 0.1 K \kms) and blue (0.1, 0.2 K \kms), the CS 2-1
    maser in white (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 K \kms integrated over -32 to 55 \kms),
    and the CS 1-0 maser in black (2000, 4000, 8000 K peak intensity over
    the range 55-74 \kms).  }
    \label{fig:overlay}
\end{figure*}

The CS J=1-0 line is only seen as a single spatial component centered
at approximately $v_{lsr}=64 \pm 6$ \kms.  It is centered closer to the
central continuum source, but still slightly toward the blueshifted outflow.
The CS J=1-0 and J=2-1 masers are offset by 0.03\arcsec (150 AU), which is
marginally significant given the absolute positional offsets.

Because of the coarse spectral resolution, the amplitude of the CS 1-0 line is
poorly constrained, and we report its fitted width and centroid assuming a
fixed amplitude of 6800 K.

\section{Analysis}
The peak brightness of the observed lines is $\sim6800$ K at $\sim0.07\arcsec$
(350 AU at 3 mm) and $\sim0.04\arcsec$ (200 AU at 7 mm) resolution.  It is unlikely that the
molecules are in thermal equilibrium at $T_K \geq 6000$ K, since such high
temperatures would more likely result in dissociation of the molecules
\citep{Black?}.

At the observed spectral resolution of 3 \kms and 6 \kms, the CS J=2-1 line is
marginally resolved with FWHM=5.25 \kms and the CS J=1-0 line is unresolved.
Since the inferred line width and the observed spectral resolution are both
much greater than the thermal width for CS at 6000 K, $v_{therm}\approx1~\kms$,
we cannot conclude anything about the intrinsic line width.

While both transitions have a consistent peak brightness of $\sim6800$ K,
which is not typical of maser transitions, these emission peaks are at
different velocities and may be from different spatial locations (separated
by about 150 AU), and therefore they are not emitted by the same material.
This velocity difference rules out a thermal origin.


Our data also include the W51 IRS2/north and W51e8 HMYSOs \citep{Ginsburg2017a}.
No compact CS emission sources were detected toward any other HMYSO candidates
in the region, with a peak CS 2-1 flux limit ${S_{98 \mathrm{GHz}} \leq 15 \mathrm{mJy~\perbeam}}$,
an order of magnitude fainter than the peaks seen in W51e2e.

%It is possible that a region within a few AU of the the central MYSO is heated
%to such high temperatures.  To provide a high enough column density of CS
%to exhibit the observed brightness, this region may have developed an
%equilibrium between CS formation and destruction.

    $\sim72.5\kms$.

\section{Conclusions}
We have detected two emission lines from the J=2-1 and J=1-0 transitions of CS
with high brightness temperature indicating that these lines are masers.
This is the first reported detection of maser emission from CS.

\appendix{Velocity check}
We carefully checked the velocity measurements in the VLA data, since
an offset of a few channels is comparable to the Earth's motion
and we are using a continuum band to infer velocity information.
The observations we analyze were take on December 26 and 30, 2016
and January 7, 2017.  On these dates, the topocentric-to-barycentric
velocity correction is -9.0, -7.4, and -4.1 \kms, respectively.
The barycentric-to-LSR correction is 16.5 \kms.
The observed CS 1-0 peak is in channel 24 (zero-indexed) of
spectral window 26, which has channel 0 at  48957.667, 48957.932, and 48958.478
MHz, respectively.  The channel width is 1 MHz.  The LSR velocity of this
channel is at 64.3 \kms on all three dates.  This value is consistent
with our reported velocity of $65.5 \pm 7.3 \kms$.

No such sanity check is needed for the ALMA data, since the channel maps clearly
show the outflow at appropriate velocities with morphology that matches the SiO
outflow seen at both 1 mm and 3mm.
