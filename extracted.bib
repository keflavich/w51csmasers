                   imaging of the 28SiO v = 1 and v = 2, J = 1-0 maser
                   emission toward the massive young stellar object
                   (YSO) Orion Source I. Both SiO transitions were
                   observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of
                   ~0.5 mas (~0.2 AU for d = 414 pc) and a spectral
                   resolution of ~0.2 km s-1. Here we explore the global
                   properties and kinematics of the emission through two
                   19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (from
                   2001 March 19 to 2002 December 10). These movies
                   provide the most detailed view to date of the
                   dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material
                   within ~20-100 AU of a massive (gsim8 M sun) YSO. As
                   in previous studies, we find that the bulk of the SiO
                   masers surrounding Source I lie in an X-shaped locus;
                   the emission in the south and east arms is
                   predominantly blueshifted, and emission in the north
                   and west is predominantly redshifted. In addition,
                   bridges of intermediate-velocity emission are
                   observed connecting the red and blue sides of the
                   emission distribution. We have measured proper
                   motions of over 1000 individual maser features and
                   found that these motions are characterized by a
                   combination of radially outward migrations along the
                   four main maser-emitting arms and motions tangent to
                   the intermediate-velocity bridges. We interpret the
                   SiO masers as arising from a wide-angle bipolar wind
                   emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. The
                   detection of maser features along extended, curved
                   filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a
                   role in launching and/or shaping the wind. Our
                   observations appear to support a picture in which
                   stars with masses as high as at least 8 M sun form
                   via disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot yet
                   rule out that the Source I disk may have been formed
                   or altered following a recent close encounter.},

                   (6,6) to (12,12). This emission comes from levels up
                   to 1500 K above the ground state, enabling
                   identification of source(s) responsible for heating
                   the region. We used this multi-transition data set to
                   produce images of the rotational/kinetic temperature
                   (T rot/T kin) and the column density N col of NH3 for

                   in a northeast-southwest elongated ridge to the
                   southeast of Source I. We have also measured the
                   ortho-para ratio of ammonia, estimated to vary in the

                   para and the offset of hot NH3 emission peaks from
                   known (proto)stellar sources provide evidence that
                   the NH3 molecules have been released from dust grains
                   into the gas phase through the passage of shocks and
                   not by stellar radiation. We propose that the

                   low-velocity outflow impinging on a pre-existing

                   (~1000 AU) outflow toward IRc7.},

                   high-mass young stellar object (YSO) with 30 M&sun;,
                   surrounded by a rotating Keplerian disk, probed by a
                   linear distribution of methanol masers. The YSO is
                   also powering a strong compact Hii region or ionized
                   wind, and is driving at least one molecular outflow.
                   The axis orientations of the different structures
                   (ionized gas, outflow, and disk) are, however,
                   misaligned, which has led to the different competing
                   models proposed to explain individual structures.
                   Aims: We investigate the 3D kinematics and dynamics
                   of circumstellar gas with very high linear
                   resolution, from tens to 1500 AU, with the ultimate
                   goal of building a comprehensive dynamical model for
                   what is considered the best high-mass accretion disk
                   candidate around an O-type young star in the northern
                   hemisphere. Methods: We used high-angular resolution
                   observations of 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers with the EVN,
                   NH3 inversion lines with the JVLA B-Array, and radio
                   continuum with the VLA A-Array. In particular, we
                   employed four different observing epochs of EVN data
                   at 6.7 GHz, spanning almost eight years, which
                   enabled us to measure line-of-sight (l.o.s.)
                   accelerations and proper motions of CH3OH masers,
                   besides l.o.s. velocities and positions (as done in
                   previous works). In addition, we imaged highly
                   excited NH3 inversion lines, from (6,6) to (13,13),
                   which enabled us to probe the hottest molecular gas
                   very close to the exciting source(s). Results: We
                   confirm previous results that five 6.7 GHz maser
                   clusters (labeled from "A" to "E") are distributed
                   over a region extended N-S across ≈1500 AU, and are
                   associated with three components of the radio
                   continuum emission. We propose that these maser
                   clusters identify three individual high-mass YSOs in
                   NGC 7538 IRS1, named IRS1a (associated with clusters
                   "B" and "C"), IRS1b (associated with cluster "A"),
                   and IRS1c (associated with cluster "E"). We find that
                   the 6.7 GHz masers distribute along a line, with a
                   regular variation in VLSR with position, along the
                   major axis of the distribution of maser cluster "A"
                   and the combined clusters "B" + "C". A similar VLSR
                   gradient (although shallower) is also detected in the
                   NH3 inversion lines. Interestingly, the variation in
                   VLSR with projected position is not linear but
                   quadratic for both maser clusters. We measure proper
                   motions for 33 maser features, which have an average
                   amplitude (4.8 $\pm$ 0.6 km s-1) similar to the
                   variation in VLSR across the maser cluster, and are
                   approximately parallel to the clusters' elongation
                   axes. By studying the time variation in the maser
                   spectrum, we also derive l.o.s. accelerations for 30
                   features, with typical amplitude of ~ 10-3-10-2 km
                   s-1 yr-1. We modeled the masers in both clusters "A"
                   and "B" + "C" in terms of an edge-on disk in
                   centrifugal equilibrium. Based on our modeling,
                   masers of clusters "B" + "C" may trace a
                   quasi-Keplerian ~1 M&sun;, thin disk, orbiting around
                   a high-mass YSO, IRS1a, of up to ≈25 M&sun;. This
                   YSO dominates the bolometric luminosity of the
                   region. The disk traced by the masers of cluster "A"
                   is both massive (≲16 M&sun; inside a radius of
                   ≈500 AU) and thick (opening angle
                   ≈45$\,^{\circ}$), and the mass of the central YSO,
                   IRS1b, is constrained to be at most a few M&sun;.
                   Towards cluster "E", NH3 and 6.7 GHz masers trace
                   more quiescent dynamics than for the other clusters.
                   The presence of a radio continuum peak suggests that
                   the YSO associated with the cluster "E", IRS1c, may
                   be an ionizing, massive YSO as well. Conclusions: We
                   present compelling evidence that NGC 7538 IRS1 is
                   forming not just one single high-mass YSO, but
                   consists of a multiple system of high-mass YSOs,
                   which are surrounded by accretion disks and are
                   probably driving individual outflows. This new model
                   naturally explains all the different orientations and
                   disk/outflow structures proposed for the region in
                   previous models. Table 2 and Appendix A are available

                   studies, high-angular resolution is crucial for
                   resolving individual protostellar outflows (and
                   possibly accretion disks) from the complex
                   contribution of nearby (high- and low-mass) young
                   stellar objects (YSO). Previous interferometric
                   studies have focused mainly on single objects. Aims:
                   A sensitive survey at high angular resolution is
                   required to investigate outflow processes in a
                   statistically significant sample of high-mass YSOs
                   and on spatial scales relevant to testing theories.
                   Methods: We selected a sample of 40 high-mass YSOs
                   from water masers observed within the BeSSeL Survey.
                   We investigated the 3D velocity and spatial
                   structures of the molecular component of massive
                   outflows at milli-arcsecond angular resolution using
                   multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
                   observations of 22 GHz water masers. We also
                   characterize the ionized component of the flows using
                   deep images of the radio continuum emission with
                   resolutions of ~0."2, at 6, 13, and 22 GHz with the
                   Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). Results: We report
                   the first results obtained for a subset of 11 objects
                   from the sample. The water maser measurements provide
                   us with a very accurate description of the molecular
                   gas kinematics. This in turn enables us to estimate
                   the momentum rate of individual outflows, varying in
                   the range 10-3-100M⊙ yr-1 km s-1, among the highest
                   values reported in the literature. In all the
                   observed objects, the continuum emission at 13 and 22
                   GHz has a compact structure, with its position
                   coincident with that of the water masers. The 6 GHz
                   continuum consists of either compact components
                   (mostly well aligned with the 13 and/or 22 GHz
                   sources) or extended emission (either highly
                   elongated or approximately spherical), which can be
                   offset by up to a few arcseconds from the water
                   masers. The unresolved continuum emission associated
                   with the water masers likely points to the YSO
                   location. The comparison of the radio continuum
                   morphology to the maser spatial and 3D velocity
                   distribution shows that five out of elevenhigh-mass
                   YSOs emit a collimated outflow, with a flow
                   semi-opening angle in the range
                   10$\,^{\circ}$-30$\,^{\circ}$. The remaining six
                   sources present a more complicated relationship
                   between the geometry of the radio continuum and water
                   maser velocity pattern; therefore, no firm
                   conclusions can be drawn regarding their outflow
                   structure. In two sources, the 6 GHz continuum
                   emission shows a highly elongated structure with a
                   negative spectral index down to -1.2. We interpret
                   this finding in terms of synchrotron emission from
                   relativistic electrons accelerated in strong shocks,
                   which indicates that non-thermal continuum emission
                   could be common in high-mass protostellar jets. The
                   Lyman continua derived from bolometric luminosities
                   always exceed those obtained from the radio
                   luminosities. Conclusions: These first results
                   suggest that collimated outflows or jets can be
                   common in high-mass YSOs and, in a couple of cases,
                   provide hints that magnetic fields could be important
                   in driving these jets. To draw firmer conclusions,
                   however, we await completion of the analysis for the
                   entire sample of 40 high-mass YSOs.},

                   star-forming regions, with the exception of five
                   known SiO maser sources. However, we detected two new
                   SiO maser sources from infrared-loud clumps of the
                   high-mass star-forming regions G19.61-0.23 and
                   G75.78+0.34. High angular resolution observations
                   toward G19.61-0.23 suggest that the deeply embedded
                   young stellar object (YSO) of SMA1 is powering the
                   SiO masers. In addition, the SiO v = 1, J = 1 \to 0
                   line shows four spike features, while the v = 2 maser
                   shows combined features of one spike and broad wing
                   components, implying energetic activities of the YSO
                   of SMA1 in the G19.61-0.23 hot molecular core. The
                   SiO v = 0, J = 2 \to 1 emission shows bipolar
                   outflows in the NE-SW direction with respect to the
                   center of the SiO maser source. A high angular
                   resolution map of the SiO v = 1, J = 2 \to 1 maser in
                   G75.78+0.34 shows that the SiO maser is associated
                   with the CORE source at the earliest stage of
                   high-mass star formation. Therefore, the newly
                   detected SiO masers and their associated outflows
                   will provide good probes for investigating this early
                   high-mass star formation.},

  abstract =      {Context. The density structure of molecular clouds
                   determines how they will evolve. Aims: We map the
                   velocity-resolved density structure of the most
                   vigorously star-forming molecular cloud in the
                   Galactic disk, the W51 giant molecular cloud.
                   Methods: We present new 2 cm and 6 cm maps of H2CO,
                   radio recombination lines, and the radio continuum in
                   the W51 star forming complex acquired with Arecibo
                   and the Green Bank Telescope at ~ 50" resolution. We
                   use H2CO absorption to determine the relative
                   line-of-sight positions of molecular and ionized gas.
                   We measure gas densities using the H2CO densitometer,
                   including continuous measurements of the dense gas
                   mass fraction (DGMF) over the range 104cm-3<n(H2) <
                   106cm-3 - this is the first time a dense gas mass
                   fraction has been measured over a range of densities
                   with a single data set. Results: The DGMF in W51 A is
                   high, f ≳ 70% above n> 104cm-3, while it is low, f<
                   20%, in W51 B. We did not detect any H2CO emission
                   throughout the W51 GMC; all gas dense enough to emit
                   under normal conditions is in front of bright
                   continuum sources and therefore is seen in absorption
                   instead. Conclusions: (1) The dense gas fraction in
                   the W51 A and B clouds shows that W51 A will continue
                   to form stars vigorously, while star formation has
                   mostly ended in W51 B. The lack of dense,
                   star-forming gas around W51 C indicates that
                   collect-and-collapse is not acting or is inefficient
                   in W51. (2) Ongoing high-mass star formation is
                   correlated with n ≳ 1 × 105cm-3 gas. Gas with n>
                   104cm-3 is weakly correlated with low and moderate
                   mass star formation, but does not strongly correlate
                   with high-mass star formation. (3) The nondetection
                   of H2CO emission implies that the emission detected
                   in other galaxies, e.g. Arp 220, comes from
                   high-density gas that is not directly affiliated with
                   already-formed massive stars. Either the
                   non-star-forming ISM of these galaxies is very dense,
                   implying the star formation density threshold is
                   higher, or H ii regions have their emission
                   suppressed. The data set has been made public at

                   ammonia (NH3) multilevel imaging studies in high-mass
                   star forming regions. Aims: We want to identify the
                   location of the maser emission from highly excited
                   levels of ammonia within the W51 IRS2 high-mass star
                   forming complex that was previously discovered in a
                   single dish monitoring program. Methods: We have used
                   the Karl Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at the 1 cm
                   band to map five highly excited metastable inversion
                   transitions of NH3, (J,K) = (6,6), (7, 7), (9, 9),
                   (10, 10), and (13, 13), in W51 IRS2 with ~0.̋2
                   angular resolution. Results: We present detections of
                   both thermal (extended) ammonia emission in the five
                   inversion lines, with rotational states ranging in
                   energy from about 400 K to 1700 K, and point-like
                   ammonia maser emission in the (6, 6), (7, 7), and (9,
                   9) lines. For the point-like emission, we estimate
                   lower limits to the peak brightness temperatures of
                   1.7 × 105 K, 6 × 103 K, and 1 × 104 K for the (6,
                   6), (7, 7), and (9, 9) transitions, respectively,
                   confirming their maser nature. The thermal ammonia
                   emits around a local standard of rest velocity of
                   VLSR = 60 km s-1, near the cloud's systemic velocity,
                   appears elongated in the east-west direction across
                   4'' and is confined by the HII regions W51d (to the
                   north), W51d1 (to the east), and W51d2 (to the west).
                   The NH3 masers are observed in the eastern tip of the
                   dense clump traced by thermal NH3, offset by 0.̋65
                   to the east from its emission peak, and have a peak
                   velocity at ~47.5 km s-1. No maser components are
                   detected near the systemic velocity. The NH3 masers
                   arise close to but separated from (0.̋65 or 3500 AU)
                   the rare vibrationally excited SiO masers, which are
                   excited in a powerful bipolar outflow driven by the
                   deeply embedded high-mass young stellar object (YSO)
                   W51-North. This means that the two maser species
                   cannot be excited by the same object. Interestingly,
                   the NH3 masers originate at the same sky position as
                   a peak in a submm line of SO2 imaged with the
                   Submillimeter Array, tracing a face-on circumstellar
                   disk or ring around W51-North. In addition, the
                   thermal emission from the most highly excited NH3
                   lines, (10, 10) and (13, 13), shows two main
                   condensations, the dominant one towards W51-North
                   with the SiO and H2O masers, and a weaker peak at the
                   NH3 maser position. Conclusions: We propose a
                   scenario where the ring seen in SO2 emission is a
                   circumbinary disk surrounding (at least) two
                   high-mass YSOs, W51-North (exciting the SiO masers)
                   and a nearby companion (exciting the NH3 masers),
                   separated by 3500 AU. This finding indicates a
                   physical connection (in a binary) between the two
                   rare SiO and NH3 maser species.},

                   in both lower-resolution (3" or ~0.1 pc) data from
                   2012 and higher-resolution (0."1 or ~1000 au) data
                   from 2018. In the higher-resolution data NH3 (2,2)
                   maser emission is detected toward five independent
                   spots. The maser spots are not spatially or
                   kinematically coincident with any other masers in

                   hypercompact H II regions in this area. While the

                   broad line widths of several kilometers per second,

                   multiple masers tracing unresolved velocity
                   structure. No other NH3 lines observed in Sgr B2 Main

  abstract =      {The detection of four formaldehyde (H2CO) maser
                   regions toward young high-mass stellar objects in the
                   last decade, in addition to the three previously
                   known regions, calls for an investigation of whether
                   H2CO masers are an exclusive tracer of young
                   high-mass stellar objects. We report the first survey
                   specifically focused on the search for 6 cm H2CO
                   masers toward non high-mass star-forming regions (non
                   HMSFRs). The observations were conducted with the 305
                   m Arecibo Telescope toward 25 low-mass star-forming
                   regions, 15 planetary nebulae and post-AGB stars, and
                   31 late-type stars. We detected no H2CO emission in
                   our sample of non HMSFRs. To check for the
                   association between high-mass star formation and H2CO
                   masers, we also conducted a survey toward 22
                   high-mass star-forming regions from a Hi-GAL
                   (Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey) sample
                   known to harbor 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers. We detected a
                   new 6 cm H2CO emission line in G32.74-0.07. This work
                   provides further evidence that supports an exclusive
                   association between H2CO masers and young regions of
                   high-mass star formation. Furthermore, we detected
                   H2CO absorption toward all Hi-GAL sources, and toward
                   24 low-mass star-forming regions. We also conducted a
                   simultaneous survey for OH (4660, 4750, 4765 MHz),
                   H110alpha (4874 MHz), HCOOH (4916 MHz), CH3OH (5005

  abstract =      {Since 1986, 10 ammonia masers have been found. Most
                   of these are found in the sources W51D, W51e1/e2,
                   NGC7538, DR21, and W33. Among them are a few masers
                   or maser candidates, arising from metastable
                   inversion lines. There are many more masers arising
                   from nonmetastable inversion lines. The most
                   outstanding is intense maser emission from the (J,K)
                   = (9,6) inversion line. Only in W51D are any masering
                   nonmetastable transitions of para-NH3 to be found.
                   Since the masering levels are more than 500 K above
                   ground state, there are a large number of levels
                   populated, and the excitation scheme must be complex.
                   It is likely that there is no unique excitation
                   scheme for all types of ammonia masers. Although
                   there have been a few attempts to model the ammonia
                   maser excitation, including excitation involving
                   vibrationally excited levels, the quest for an
                   all-encompassing ammonia maser excitation model is
                   still going on.},

  abstract =      {IRAS 19312+1950 is a peculiar object that has eluded
                   firm characterization since its discovery, with
                   combined maser properties similar to an evolved star
                   and a young stellar object (YSO). To help determine
                   its true nature, we obtained infrared spectra of IRAS
                   19312+1950 in the range 5-550 mum using the Herschel
                   and Spitzer space observatories. The Herschel PACS
                   maps exhibit a compact, slightly asymmetric continuum
                   source at 170 mum, indicative of a large, dusty
                   circumstellar envelope. The far-IR CO emission line
                   spectrum reveals two gas temperature components:
                   ≈0.22 M &sun; of material at 280 $\pm$ 18 K, and
                   ≈1.6 M &sun; of material at 157 $\pm$ 3 K. The O i
                   63 mum line is detected on-source but no significant
                   emission from atomic ions was found. The HIFI
                   observations display shocked, high-velocity gas with
                   outflow speeds up to 90 km s-1 along the line of
                   sight. From Spitzer spectroscopy, we identify ice
                   absorption bands due to H2O at 5.8 mum and CO2 at 15
                   mum. The spectral energy distribution is consistent
                   with a massive, luminous (˜2 × 104 L &sun;) central
                   source surrounded by a dense, warm circumstellar disk
                   and envelope of total mass ˜500-700 M &sun;, with
                   large bipolar outflow cavities. The combination of
                   distinctive far-IR spectral features suggest that
                   IRAS 19312+1950 should be classified as an accreting,
                   high-mass YSO rather than an evolved star. In light
                   of this reclassification, IRAS 19312+1950 becomes
                   only the fifth high-mass protostar known to exhibit
                   SiO maser activity, and demonstrates that 18 cm OH
                   maser line ratios may not be reliable observational
                   discriminators between evolved stars and YSOs.

                   emission lines formed in the winds of cool giants and

                   particles, from the stellar photosphere, and the

                   a maser region for the mass accretion rate less than

                   circumstellar shell of IRC +10216 using the NRAO 12 m
                   telescope and the CSO. The J=3-->2, 6-->5, and 7-->6
                   transitions in the v=1 level at 146, 292, and 340 GHz
                   have been detected toward this object, and the
                   J=2-->1 and 5-->4 lines were also reobserved. After
                   accounting for contamination from other species,
                   these CS transitions all exhibit line profiles that
                   are narrower (DeltaV1/2~10 km s-1) than those
                   displayed by most molecules in IRC +10216, indicating
                   an origin in the inner stellar envelope. The J=3-->2
                   line is particularly narrow (DeltaV1/2~1-2 km s-1),
                   and consists of two separate velocity components at
                   VLSR~-26 and -22 km s-1. These characteristics are
                   suggestive of weak maser action in this transition.
                   The narrow line widths observed in the other
                   transitions indicate a source size <~0.5", which
                   implies a CS column density in the v=1 state of
                   ~2-6×1016 cm-2. The ground-state (v=0) column
                   density is therefore on the order of 0.8-2×1018 cm-2
                   for Tvib=500 K. The fractional abundance of CS
                   relative to H2 is consequently f~3-7×10-5 at ~14 R*.
                   Such a high abundance close to the stellar
                   photosphere is strong evidence that CS is a
                   ``parent'' molecule in IRC +10216, as suggested by
                   infrared studies of the v=0-->1 vibrational
                   transition and interferometric observations.},

                   onto the main sequence, but this hypothesis has not
                   been observationally tested. We present ALMA
                   observations of a 3× 1.5 pc area in the W51
                   high-mass star-forming complex. We identify dust
                   continuum sources and measure the gas and dust
                   temperature through both rotational diagram modeling
                   of {{CH}}3{OH} and brightness-temperature-based
                   limits. The observed region contains three high-mass
                   YSOs that appear to be at the earliest stages of
                   their formation, with no signs of ionizing radiation
                   from their central sources. The data reveal high gas
                   and dust temperatures (T> 100 K) extending out to
                   about 5000 au from each of these sources. There are
                   no clear signs of disks or rotating structures down
                   to our 1000 au resolution. The extended warm gas
                   provides evidence that, during the process of
                   forming, these high-mass stars heat a large volume
                   and correspondingly large mass of gas in their
                   surroundings, inhibiting fragmentation and therefore
                   keeping a large reservoir available to feed from. By
                   contrast, the more mature massive stars that
                   illuminate compact {{H}} {{II}} regions have little
                   effect on their surrounding dense gas, suggesting
                   that these main-sequence stars have completed most or
                   all of their accretion. The high luminosity of the
                   massive protostars (L> {10}4 {L}o ), combined with a
                   lack of centimeter continuum emission from these
                   sources, implies that they are not on the main
                   sequence while they accrete the majority of their
                   mass; instead, they may be bloated and cool.},

                   Eleven of these inversion lines, the (J, K) = (6, 2),
                   (5, 3), (7, 4), (8, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (9, 7), (10,
                   7), (9, 9), (10, 9), and (12, 12) transitions, are
                   classified as masers for the first time in outer
                   space. All detected masers are related to highly
                   excited inversion doublets. The (5, 4) maser
                   originates from an inversion doublet ~340 K above the
                   ground state, while the (12, 12) transition, at ~1450
                   K, is the most highly excited NH3 maser line so far
                   known. Strong variability is seen not only in ortho-
                   but also in para-NH3 transitions. Bright narrow
                   emission features are observed, for the first time,
                   in (mostly) ortho-ammonia transitions, at VLSR ~ 45
                   km s-1, well separated from the quasi-thermal
                   emission near 60 km s-1. These features were absent
                   ~25 years ago and show a velocity drift of about +0.2
                   km s-1 yr-1. The component is likely related to the
                   SiO maser source in W51-IRS2 and a possible scenario
                   explaining the velocity drift is outlined. The 57 km
                   s-1 component of the (9, 6) maser line is found to be
                   strongly linearly polarised. Maser emission in the
                   (J, K) to (J + 1, K) inversion doublets is strictly
                   forbidden by selection rules for electric dipole
                   transitions in the ground vibrational state. However,
                   such pairs (and even triplets with (J + 2, K)) are
                   common toward W51-IRS2. Similarities in line widths
                   and velocities indicate that such groups of maser
                   lines arise from the same regions, which can be
                   explained by pumping through vibrational excitation.
                   The large number of NH3 maser lines in W51-IRS2 is
                   most likely related to the exceptionally high kinetic
                   temperature and NH3 column density of this young
                   massive star forming region.},

                   Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array
                   (VLBA). Our images of the H2O maser emission in
                   W51-IRS 2 reveal two maser complexes bracketing the
                   SiO maser source. One of these H2O maser complexes
                   appears to trace a bow shock whose opening angle is
                   consistent with the opening angle observed in the
                   distribution of SiO maser emission. A comparison of
                   our H2O maser image with an image constructed from
                   data acquired 19 years earlier clearly shows the
                   persistence and motion of this bow shock. The proper
                   motions correspond to an outflow velocity of 80 km
                   s-1, which is consistent with the data of 19 years
                   ago (that spanned 2 years). We have discovered a
                   two-armed linear structure in the SiO maser emission
                   on scales of ~25 AU, and we find a velocity gradient
                   on the order of 0.1 km s-1 AU-1 along the arms. We
                   propose that the SiO maser source traces the limbs of
                   an accelerating bipolar outflow close to an obscured
                   protostar. We estimate that the outflow makes an
                   angle of less than 20$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the
                   plane of the sky. Our measurement of the acceleration
                   is consistent with a reported drift in the
                   line-of-sight velocity of the W51 SiO maser source.},

  abstract =      {Context. This paper is the third in a series of NH3
                   multilevel imaging studies in well-known, high-mass
                   star-forming regions. The main goal is to
                   characterize kinematics and physical conditions of
                   (hot and dense) circumstellar molecular gas around
                   O-type young stars. Aims: We want to map at
                   subarcsecond resolution highly excited inversion
                   lines of NH3 in the high-mass star-forming region W51
                   Main (distance = 5.4 kpc), which is an ideal target
                   to constrain theoretical models of high-mass star
                   formation. Methods: Using the Karl Jansky Very Large
                   Array (JVLA), we mapped the hot and dense molecular
                   gas in W51 Main with ~0.2 arcsec-0.3 arcsec angular
                   resolution in five metastable (J = K) inversion
                   transitions of ammonia (NH3): (J,K) = (6, 6), (7, 7),
                   (9, 9), (10, 10), and (13, 13). These lines arise
                   from energy levels between ~400 K and ~1700 K above
                   the ground state. We also made maps of the
                   (free-free) continuum emission at frequencies between
                   25 and 36 GHz. Results: We have identified and
                   characterized two main centers of high-mass star
                   formation in W51 Main, which excite hot cores and
                   host one or multiple high-mass young stellar objects
                   (YSOs) at their centers: the W51e2 complex and the
                   W51e8 core (~6'' southward of W51e2). The former
                   breaks down into three further subcores: W51e2-W,
                   which surrounds the well-known hypercompact (HC) HII
                   region, where hot NH3 is observed in absorption, and
                   two additional dusty cores, W51e2-E (~0.8 arcsec to
                   the East) and W51e2-NW (~1'' to the North), where hot
                   NH3 is observed in emission. The velocity maps toward
                   the HC HII region show a clear velocity gradient
                   along the east-west in all lines. The gradient may
                   indicate rotation, although any Keplerian motion must
                   be on smaller scales (<1000 AU) as we do not directly
                   observe a Keplerian velocity profile. The absence of
                   outflow and/or maser activity and the low amount of
                   molecular gas available for accretion (~5 M&sun;,
                   assuming [NH3]/[H2] = 10-7) with respect to the mass
                   of the central YSO estimated from radio luminosity
                   (>20 M&sun;), both indicate that the central YSO has
                   already accreted most of its final mass. On the other
                   hand, the nearby W51e2-E, while not showing evidence
                   of rotation, shows signatures of infall in a hot
                   dense core (T ~ 170 K, nH2 ~ 5 × 107 cm-3), based on
                   asymmetric spectral profiles (skewed toward the
                   blueshifted component) in optically thick emission
                   lines of NH3. The relatively large amount of hot
                   molecular gas available for accretion (~20 M&sun;
                   within about half an arcsecond or 2500 AU), along
                   with strong outflow and maser activity, indicates
                   that the main accretion center in the W51e2 complex
                   is W51e2-E rather than W51e2-W. Finally, W51e2-NW and
                   W51e8, although less dense (nH2 ~ 2 × 107 cm-3 and ~
                   3 × 106 cm-3), are also hot cores (Tgas ~ 140 and
                   200 K) and contain a significant amount of molecular
                   gas (Mgas ~ 30M&sun; and ~70 M&sun;, respectively).
                   We speculate that they may host high-mass YSOs either
                   at a previous evolutionary stage or with a mass that
                   is lower than W51e2-E and W51e2-W. Conclusions: Using
                   high-angular resolution multilevel imaging of highly
                   excited NH3 metastable lines, we characterized the
                   physical and dynamical properties of four individual
                   high-mass young stars forming in the W51 Main clump.

  abstract =      {Understanding the formation of massive stars is one
                   of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy. The
                   main difficulty is that the intense radiation from
                   the high-luminosity stars and the thermal pressure
                   from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant
                   for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse the
                   accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting
                   fresh material. Such feedback effects can naturally
                   be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs,
                   which is the established mechanism to form sun-like
                   stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown
                   that accretion on 1000 au scales is through filaments
                   rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction
                   has never been confirmed via observations owing to
                   the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000
                   au). Here we present the first observational evidence
                   that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming
                   in protoclusters is predominantly asymmetric and
                   disordered. In particular, we observed the innermost
                   regions around three deeply embedded high-mass
                   protostars with very high spatial resolution (~100
                   au). We identified multiple massive (several solar
                   masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers
                   pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret
                   as multi-directional accretion channels. These
                   structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady
                   disc. Nevertheless, the identification of fast
                   collimated outflows in the three observed systems
                   indicates that (non-steady) compact discs may be
                   present (we measure upper limits on their radii of
                   <80 for one object and <350 astronomical units for
                   the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts
                   with the simplified classic paradigm of an ordered
                   (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an
                   experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and
                   unsteady accretion model for massive star formation
                   supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic
                   simulations.},

                   100 trillion cm the temperature drops to about 1500
                   K, and dust grains begin to condense. Radiation
                   pressure on the newly formed grains drives the
                   material outward, leading to a mass loss rate of
                   about 1/1000 solar mass/yr at a final velocity of 18
                   km/sec, provided the dust is underabundant by about
                   factor 10. The maser turns on when the expansion
                   velocity exceeds the mean turbulent velocity, so the
                   nature of the velocity field changes from chaotic to
                   ordered, and the required coherence can build up.
                   Because the dust is optically thick, the SiO
                   vibration transitions are exposed to an undiluted
                   blackbody radiation field, and the only way to
                   deviate from thermal equilibrium is for the gas to be
                   warmer than the dust. This requirement can be obeyed
                   for a rather limited set of parameters which may
                   explain the uniqueness of Orion as the only star
                   formation region displaying an SiO maser.},

                   (VO) tables, and common ASCII table formats, unit and
                   physical quantity conversions, physical constants
                   specific to astronomy, celestial coordinate and time
                   transformations, world coordinate system (WCS)
                   support, generalized containers for representing
                   gridded as well as tabular data, and a framework for
                   cosmological transformations and conversions.
                   Significant functionality is under activedevelopment,
                   such as a model fitting framework, VO client and
                   server tools, and aperture and point spread function
                   (PSF) photometry tools. The core development team is
