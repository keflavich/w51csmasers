                   0.000001 and 0.0001 solar mass/yr, performing
                   radiative transfer calculations for molecular
                   emission lines formed in the winds of cool giants and
                   supergiants. These calculations included excitation
                   of collisions with H2 as well as scattering of IR and
                   microwave radiation emergent from warm dust
                   particles, from the stellar photosphere, and the
                   cosmic background radiation. It was found that, for
                   (C-12)O molecules, there are three distinct regions
                   of mass loss: an LTE region for the mass accretion
                   rate greater than about 0.00003 solar mass/yr, where
                   the (C-12)O molecules are nearly exclusively excited
                   by collisions; an NLTE region for the mass accretion
                   rate between 0.000003 and 0.00003 solar mass/yr; and
                   a maser region for the mass accretion rate less than
                   0.000003 solar mass/yr. For (C-13)O and CS, no LTE
                   region is present and masers appear at rather large
                   mass loss rates. The line formation processes are
                   discussed in detail.},

  abstract =      {Understanding the formation of massive stars is one
                   of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy. The
                   main difficulty is that the intense radiation from
                   the high-luminosity stars and the thermal pressure
                   from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant
                   for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse the
                   accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting
                   fresh material. Such feedback effects can naturally
                   be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs,
                   which is the established mechanism to form sun-like
                   stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown
                   that accretion on 1000 au scales is through filaments
                   rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction
                   has never been confirmed via observations owing to
                   the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000
                   au). Here we present the first observational evidence
                   that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming
                   in protoclusters is predominantly asymmetric and
                   disordered. In particular, we observed the innermost
                   regions around three deeply embedded high-mass
                   protostars with very high spatial resolution (~100
                   au). We identified multiple massive (several solar
                   masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers
                   pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret
                   as multi-directional accretion channels. These
                   structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady
                   disc. Nevertheless, the identification of fast
                   collimated outflows in the three observed systems
                   indicates that (non-steady) compact discs may be
                   present (we measure upper limits on their radii of
                   <80 for one object and <350 astronomical units for
                   the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts
                   with the simplified classic paradigm of an ordered
                   (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an
                   experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and
                   unsteady accretion model for massive star formation
                   supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic
                   simulations.},

  abstract =      {High-mass stars have generally been assumed to
                   accrete most of their mass while already contracted
                   onto the main sequence, but this hypothesis has not
                   been observationally tested. We present ALMA
                   observations of a 3Ã— 1.5 pc area in the W51
                   high-mass star-forming complex. We identify dust
                   continuum sources and measure the gas and dust
                   temperature through both rotational diagram modeling
                   of {{CH}}3{OH} and brightness-temperature-based
                   limits. The observed region contains three high-mass
                   YSOs that appear to be at the earliest stages of
                   their formation, with no signs of ionizing radiation
                   from their central sources. The data reveal high gas
                   and dust temperatures (T> 100 K) extending out to
                   about 5000 au from each of these sources. There are
                   no clear signs of disks or rotating structures down
                   to our 1000 au resolution. The extended warm gas
                   provides evidence that, during the process of
                   forming, these high-mass stars heat a large volume
                   and correspondingly large mass of gas in their
                   surroundings, inhibiting fragmentation and therefore
                   keeping a large reservoir available to feed from. By
                   contrast, the more mature massive stars that
                   illuminate compact {{H}} {{II}} regions have little
                   effect on their surrounding dense gas, suggesting
                   that these main-sequence stars have completed most or
                   all of their accretion. The high luminosity of the
                   massive protostars (L> {10}4 {L}o ), combined with a
                   lack of centimeter continuum emission from these
                   sources, implies that they are not on the main
                   sequence while they accrete the majority of their
                   mass; instead, they may be bloated and cool.},
