                   transition of methanol toward a large number of
                   star-forming regions. Essentially all 6.6 GHz maser
                   sources found are associated with interstellar OH
                   masers. Toward a number of sources, the 6.6 GHz
                   emission has flux densities of several thousand Jy,
                   exceeding that of any known OH maser. Since all known
                   masers in the 12 GHz (20) yields (3-1)E transition
                   that are observationally accessible have been found
                   to have 6.6 GHz counterparts, the latter line is
                   undoubtedly a Class-II methanol-maser transition. In
                   all cases the 6.6 GHz luminosity exceeds the 12 GHz
                   luminosity, often by large factors. Toward Class-I
                   methanol maser regions, the 6.6 GHz line is observed
                   in absorption, as has been predicted by pumping

                   together with a number of other sites of star
                   formation. We have also observed previously reported
                   methanol masers south of declination 24 deg. Where we
                   detected methanol emission, we measured its position
                   and have found more than 40 instances of small
                   clusters of sources. We present observations of a
                   total of 245 methanol masers with peak intensities
                   ranging from 0.3 to 5000 Jy. For a typical source,
                   the velocity range of the emission is quite large -
                   commonly 10 km s^-1 and, in a few instances,
                   exceeding 20 km s^-1. Some of the largest velocity
                   ranges are suggestive of emission from an outflow
                   region as well as a central source. Our observtions
                   over several epochs show that many sources possess at
                   least some features whose intensity varies on a
                   time-scale of several months. Towards most of the
                   6.6-GHz masers we have searched for 12-GHz methanol
                   maser emission, and have made 131 detections; the
                   median ratio of 12-to 6.6-GHz intensity if 0.11. We
                   discuss the general properties of this large sample
                   of 6.6-GHz methanol masers. They appear to be more
                   prevalent than OH masers, with intensities typically
                   seven times higher, and are thus excellent tracers of
                   compact H II regions and sites of recent star
                   formation.},

                   (6,6) to (12,12). This emission comes from levels up
                   to 1500 K above the ground state, enabling
                   identification of source(s) responsible for heating
                   the region. We used this multi-transition data set to
                   produce images of the rotational/kinetic temperature
                   (T rot/T kin) and the column density N col of NH3 for

                   respectively. Our spatially resolved images show that
                   the highest (column) density and hottest gas is found
                   in a northeast-southwest elongated ridge to the
                   southeast of Source I. We have also measured the
                   ortho-para ratio of ammonia, estimated to vary in the
                   range 0.9-1.6. Enhancement of ortho with respect to
                   para and the offset of hot NH3 emission peaks from
                   known (proto)stellar sources provide evidence that
                   the NH3 molecules have been released from dust grains
                   into the gas phase through the passage of shocks and
                   not by stellar radiation. We propose that the
                   combined effect of Source I's proper motion and its
                   low-velocity outflow impinging on a pre-existing
                   dense medium is responsible for the excitation of NH3
                   and the Orion Hot Core. Finally, we found for the
                   first time evidence of a slow (~5 km s-1) and compact
                   (~1000 AU) outflow toward IRc7.},

                   high-mass young stellar object (YSO) with 30 M&sun;,
                   surrounded by a rotating Keplerian disk, probed by a
                   linear distribution of methanol masers. The YSO is
                   also powering a strong compact Hii region or ionized
                   wind, and is driving at least one molecular outflow.
                   The axis orientations of the different structures
                   (ionized gas, outflow, and disk) are, however,
                   misaligned, which has led to the different competing
                   models proposed to explain individual structures.
                   Aims: We investigate the 3D kinematics and dynamics
                   of circumstellar gas with very high linear
                   resolution, from tens to 1500 AU, with the ultimate
                   goal of building a comprehensive dynamical model for
                   what is considered the best high-mass accretion disk
                   candidate around an O-type young star in the northern
                   hemisphere. Methods: We used high-angular resolution
                   observations of 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers with the EVN,
                   NH3 inversion lines with the JVLA B-Array, and radio
                   continuum with the VLA A-Array. In particular, we
                   employed four different observing epochs of EVN data
                   at 6.7 GHz, spanning almost eight years, which
                   enabled us to measure line-of-sight (l.o.s.)
                   accelerations and proper motions of CH3OH masers,
                   besides l.o.s. velocities and positions (as done in
                   previous works). In addition, we imaged highly
                   excited NH3 inversion lines, from (6,6) to (13,13),
                   which enabled us to probe the hottest molecular gas
                   very close to the exciting source(s). Results: We
                   confirm previous results that five 6.7 GHz maser
                   clusters (labeled from "A" to "E") are distributed
                   over a region extended N-S across ≈1500 AU, and are
                   associated with three components of the radio
                   continuum emission. We propose that these maser
                   clusters identify three individual high-mass YSOs in
                   NGC 7538 IRS1, named IRS1a (associated with clusters
                   "B" and "C"), IRS1b (associated with cluster "A"),
                   and IRS1c (associated with cluster "E"). We find that
                   the 6.7 GHz masers distribute along a line, with a
                   regular variation in VLSR with position, along the
                   major axis of the distribution of maser cluster "A"
                   and the combined clusters "B" + "C". A similar VLSR
                   gradient (although shallower) is also detected in the
                   NH3 inversion lines. Interestingly, the variation in
                   VLSR with projected position is not linear but
                   quadratic for both maser clusters. We measure proper
                   motions for 33 maser features, which have an average
                   amplitude (4.8 $\pm$ 0.6 km s-1) similar to the
                   variation in VLSR across the maser cluster, and are
                   approximately parallel to the clusters' elongation
                   axes. By studying the time variation in the maser
                   spectrum, we also derive l.o.s. accelerations for 30
                   features, with typical amplitude of ~ 10-3-10-2 km
                   s-1 yr-1. We modeled the masers in both clusters "A"
                   and "B" + "C" in terms of an edge-on disk in
                   centrifugal equilibrium. Based on our modeling,
                   masers of clusters "B" + "C" may trace a
                   quasi-Keplerian ~1 M&sun;, thin disk, orbiting around
                   a high-mass YSO, IRS1a, of up to ≈25 M&sun;. This
                   YSO dominates the bolometric luminosity of the
                   region. The disk traced by the masers of cluster "A"
                   is both massive (≲16 M&sun; inside a radius of
                   ≈500 AU) and thick (opening angle
                   ≈45$\,^{\circ}$), and the mass of the central YSO,
                   IRS1b, is constrained to be at most a few M&sun;.
                   Towards cluster "E", NH3 and 6.7 GHz masers trace
                   more quiescent dynamics than for the other clusters.
                   The presence of a radio continuum peak suggests that
                   the YSO associated with the cluster "E", IRS1c, may
                   be an ionizing, massive YSO as well. Conclusions: We
                   present compelling evidence that NGC 7538 IRS1 is
                   forming not just one single high-mass YSO, but
                   consists of a multiple system of high-mass YSOs,
                   which are surrounded by accretion disks and are
                   probably driving individual outflows. This new model
                   naturally explains all the different orientations and
                   disk/outflow structures proposed for the region in
                   previous models. Table 2 and Appendix A are available

                   observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of
                   ~0.5 mas (~0.2 AU for d = 414 pc) and a spectral
                   resolution of ~0.2 km s-1. Here we explore the global
                   properties and kinematics of the emission through two
                   19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (from
                   2001 March 19 to 2002 December 10). These movies
                   provide the most detailed view to date of the
                   dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material
                   within ~20-100 AU of a massive (gsim8 M sun) YSO. As
                   in previous studies, we find that the bulk of the SiO
                   masers surrounding Source I lie in an X-shaped locus;
                   the emission in the south and east arms is
                   predominantly blueshifted, and emission in the north
                   and west is predominantly redshifted. In addition,
                   bridges of intermediate-velocity emission are
                   observed connecting the red and blue sides of the
                   emission distribution. We have measured proper
                   motions of over 1000 individual maser features and
                   found that these motions are characterized by a
                   combination of radially outward migrations along the
                   four main maser-emitting arms and motions tangent to
                   the intermediate-velocity bridges. We interpret the
                   SiO masers as arising from a wide-angle bipolar wind
                   emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. The
                   detection of maser features along extended, curved
                   filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a
                   role in launching and/or shaping the wind. Our
                   observations appear to support a picture in which
                   stars with masses as high as at least 8 M sun form
                   via disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot yet
                   rule out that the Source I disk may have been formed
                   or altered following a recent close encounter.},

                   with the CORE source at the earliest stage of

  abstract =      {Context. The density structure of molecular clouds
                   determines how they will evolve. Aims: We map the
                   velocity-resolved density structure of the most
                   vigorously star-forming molecular cloud in the
                   Galactic disk, the W51 giant molecular cloud.
                   Methods: We present new 2 cm and 6 cm maps of H2CO,
                   radio recombination lines, and the radio continuum in
                   the W51 star forming complex acquired with Arecibo
                   and the Green Bank Telescope at ~ 50" resolution. We
                   use H2CO absorption to determine the relative
                   line-of-sight positions of molecular and ionized gas.
                   We measure gas densities using the H2CO densitometer,
                   including continuous measurements of the dense gas
                   mass fraction (DGMF) over the range 104cm-3<n(H2) <
                   106cm-3 - this is the first time a dense gas mass
                   fraction has been measured over a range of densities
                   with a single data set. Results: The DGMF in W51 A is
                   high, f ≳ 70% above n> 104cm-3, while it is low, f<
                   20%, in W51 B. We did not detect any H2CO emission
                   throughout the W51 GMC; all gas dense enough to emit
                   under normal conditions is in front of bright
                   continuum sources and therefore is seen in absorption
                   instead. Conclusions: (1) The dense gas fraction in
                   the W51 A and B clouds shows that W51 A will continue
                   to form stars vigorously, while star formation has
                   mostly ended in W51 B. The lack of dense,
                   star-forming gas around W51 C indicates that
                   collect-and-collapse is not acting or is inefficient
                   in W51. (2) Ongoing high-mass star formation is
                   correlated with n ≳ 1 × 105cm-3 gas. Gas with n>
                   104cm-3 is weakly correlated with low and moderate
                   mass star formation, but does not strongly correlate
                   with high-mass star formation. (3) The nondetection
                   of H2CO emission implies that the emission detected
                   in other galaxies, e.g. Arp 220, comes from
                   high-density gas that is not directly affiliated with
                   already-formed massive stars. Either the
                   non-star-forming ISM of these galaxies is very dense,
                   implying the star formation density threshold is
                   higher, or H ii regions have their emission
                   suppressed. The data set has been made public at

                   from 2018. In the higher-resolution data NH3 (2,2)
                   maser emission is detected toward five independent
                   spots. The maser spots are not spatially or
                   kinematically coincident with any other masers in

                   broad line widths of several kilometers per second,

                   multiple masers tracing unresolved velocity
                   structure. No other NH3 lines observed in Sgr B2 Main

                   (NH3) maser lines have been detected toward the
                   prominent massive star forming region W51-IRS2.
                   Eleven of these inversion lines, the (J, K) = (6, 2),
                   (5, 3), (7, 4), (8, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (9, 7), (10,
                   7), (9, 9), (10, 9), and (12, 12) transitions, are
                   classified as masers for the first time in outer
                   space. All detected masers are related to highly
                   excited inversion doublets. The (5, 4) maser
                   originates from an inversion doublet ~340 K above the
                   ground state, while the (12, 12) transition, at ~1450
                   K, is the most highly excited NH3 maser line so far
                   known. Strong variability is seen not only in ortho-
                   but also in para-NH3 transitions. Bright narrow
                   emission features are observed, for the first time,
                   in (mostly) ortho-ammonia transitions, at VLSR ~ 45
                   km s-1, well separated from the quasi-thermal
                   emission near 60 km s-1. These features were absent
                   ~25 years ago and show a velocity drift of about +0.2
                   km s-1 yr-1. The component is likely related to the
                   SiO maser source in W51-IRS2 and a possible scenario
                   explaining the velocity drift is outlined. The 57 km
                   s-1 component of the (9, 6) maser line is found to be
                   strongly linearly polarised. Maser emission in the
                   (J, K) to (J + 1, K) inversion doublets is strictly
                   forbidden by selection rules for electric dipole
                   transitions in the ground vibrational state. However,
                   such pairs (and even triplets with (J + 2, K)) are
                   common toward W51-IRS2. Similarities in line widths
                   and velocities indicate that such groups of maser
                   lines arise from the same regions, which can be
                   explained by pumping through vibrational excitation.
                   The large number of NH3 maser lines in W51-IRS2 is
                   most likely related to the exceptionally high kinetic
                   temperature and NH3 column density of this young
                   massive star forming region.},

                   Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array
                   (VLBA). Our images of the H2O maser emission in
                   W51-IRS 2 reveal two maser complexes bracketing the
                   SiO maser source. One of these H2O maser complexes
                   appears to trace a bow shock whose opening angle is
                   consistent with the opening angle observed in the
                   distribution of SiO maser emission. A comparison of
                   our H2O maser image with an image constructed from
                   data acquired 19 years earlier clearly shows the
                   persistence and motion of this bow shock. The proper
                   motions correspond to an outflow velocity of 80 km
                   s-1, which is consistent with the data of 19 years
                   ago (that spanned 2 years). We have discovered a
                   two-armed linear structure in the SiO maser emission
                   on scales of ~25 AU, and we find a velocity gradient
                   on the order of 0.1 km s-1 AU-1 along the arms. We
                   propose that the SiO maser source traces the limbs of
                   an accelerating bipolar outflow close to an obscured
                   protostar. We estimate that the outflow makes an
                   angle of less than 20$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the
                   plane of the sky. Our measurement of the acceleration
                   is consistent with a reported drift in the
                   line-of-sight velocity of the W51 SiO maser source.},

                   of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy. The
                   main difficulty is that the intense radiation from
                   the high-luminosity stars and the thermal pressure
                   from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant
                   for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse the
                   accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting
                   fresh material. Such feedback effects can naturally
                   be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs,
                   which is the established mechanism to form sun-like
                   stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown
                   that accretion on 1000 au scales is through filaments
                   rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction
                   has never been confirmed via observations owing to
                   the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000
                   au). Here we present the first observational evidence
                   that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming
                   in protoclusters is predominantly asymmetric and

                   masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers
                   pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret
                   as multi-directional accretion channels. These
                   structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady
                   disc. Nevertheless, the identification of fast
                   collimated outflows in the three observed systems
                   indicates that (non-steady) compact discs may be
                   present (we measure upper limits on their radii of
                   <80 for one object and <350 astronomical units for
                   the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts
                   with the simplified classic paradigm of an ordered
                   (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an
                   experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and
                   unsteady accretion model for massive star formation
                   supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic
                   simulations.},

                   electronic states. New ab initio potential curves and
                   transition dipole moment functions have been obtained
                   for these computations using the multi-reference
                   configuration interaction approach with the Davidson
                   correction (MRCI+Q) and aug-cc-pV6Z basis sets.
                   State-resolved cross sections have been computed for
                   transitions from nearly the full range of
                   rovibrational levels of the X 1Sigma+ state and for
                   photon wavelengths ranging from 500 {\AA} to
                   threshold. Destruction of CS via predissociation in
                   highly excited electronic states originating from the
                   rovibrational ground state is found to be
                   unimportant. Photodissociation cross sections are
                   presented for temperatures in the range between 1000
                   and 10,000 K, where a Boltzmann distribution of
                   initial rovibrational levels is assumed. Applications
                   of the current computations to various astrophysical
                   environments are briefly discussed focusing on
                   photodissociation rates due to the standard
                   interstellar and blackbody radiation fields.},

  abstract =      {High-mass stars have generally been assumed to
                   accrete most of their mass while already contracted
                   onto the main sequence, but this hypothesis has not
                   been observationally tested. We present ALMA
                   observations of a 3× 1.5 pc area in the W51
                   high-mass star-forming complex. We identify dust
                   continuum sources and measure the gas and dust
                   temperature through both rotational diagram modeling
                   of {{CH}}3{OH} and brightness-temperature-based
                   limits. The observed region contains three high-mass
                   YSOs that appear to be at the earliest stages of
                   their formation, with no signs of ionizing radiation
                   from their central sources. The data reveal high gas
                   and dust temperatures (T> 100 K) extending out to
                   about 5000 au from each of these sources. There are
                   no clear signs of disks or rotating structures down
                   to our 1000 au resolution. The extended warm gas
                   provides evidence that, during the process of
                   forming, these high-mass stars heat a large volume
                   and correspondingly large mass of gas in their
                   surroundings, inhibiting fragmentation and therefore
                   keeping a large reservoir available to feed from. By
                   contrast, the more mature massive stars that
                   illuminate compact {{H}} {{II}} regions have little
                   effect on their surrounding dense gas, suggesting
                   that these main-sequence stars have completed most or
                   all of their accretion. The high luminosity of the
                   massive protostars (L> {10}4 {L}o ), combined with a
                   lack of centimeter continuum emission from these
                   sources, implies that they are not on the main
                   sequence while they accrete the majority of their
                   mass; instead, they may be bloated and cool.},
